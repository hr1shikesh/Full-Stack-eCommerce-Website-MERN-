# Full-Stack-eCommerce-Website-MERN-
This project involves the creation of a full-stack eCommerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform is designed to simulate a real-world online store with features for product browsing, user authentication, cart management, and administrative control over inventory and user accounts.
